        <p>Tourists might want to visit non-tourist locations in Nepal but they are worried about finding places to stay and eat. With this service, any person in any location in Nepal can offer paying guest services for tourists. Tourists will be able to search for available services near their destination and book a service of their choice. This way, people in remote places can generate income from paying guests. Also, tourists will be more inclined to discover new locations in Nepal if their housing/eating arrangements are taken care of. They will also be able to get the authentic experience of Nepalese culture by living and eating with family instead of at a hotel.</p>
